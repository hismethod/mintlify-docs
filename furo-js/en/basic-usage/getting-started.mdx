### Step 1: Adding the Script to Your HTML File

Please add the following script file inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML.<br/>

```html
<script src="https://cdn.furo.one/sdk/furo.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Initializing Furo.js

Add the script block below inside the `<body>` tag.
If the initialization is successful, you should see a message `Furo JS initialized` in the console.
For more details on initialization, check [here](/furo-js/en/guides/setup#initialize).

```html
<script>
  furo.init({
    clientId: '65e15c26cfe10dc6796cb44409933163',
    publicApiKey: 'apikey-public-live-c2235f19-73a7-4d3f-84f2-e5f241d39285',
  });
</script>
```

### Step 3: Adding a Login Button

Copy the `<button>` tag and paste it into your HTML editor, then give it a try.

```html
<button onclick="furo.open('login')">Login</button>
```

### Step 4: Trying Out the Login

Did you see the login UI appear when you clicked the button?<br/>
Try logging in with your account.<br/>

<Accordion title="Is it safe to try logging in?">
  The login UI you see is a sample project created by Furo, which is securely
  managed by Furo. <br />
  Rest assured, no one else can see your information, so feel free to try logging
  in.
</Accordion>

### Step 5: Retrieving Logged-In User Information

Now, you can retrieve the logged-in user's information from anywhere using `furo.user`.
Try printing `furo.user` in the console of the developer tools.

```js
console.log(furo.user);
```
