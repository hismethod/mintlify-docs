Furo provides various types of login methods.
By using the UI Component, you can utilize pre-implemented UIs for all types of login.

This section also explains how to receive events triggered during login or logout.

## Login

Login is currently provided through the UI.
For more details, refer to [Login Component](/furo-js/guides/ui-component/login-component).

## Logout

Logs out the user.

```js
furo.logout();
```

## Receiving Events

For login/logout, `login` / `logout` events are triggered respectively.
For more details on the events, refer to [Event](/furo-js/guides/event).

```js
furo.on('login', function (user) {
  // Logged-in user
  const currentUser = user;
});

furo.on('logout', function () {
  // Logged out
});
```
