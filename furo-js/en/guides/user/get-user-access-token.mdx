description: "How to Obtain a User's Access Token"
---

To authenticate the user and communicate with the server, you need the user's access token.

You can obtain the user's access token by calling the `getAccessTokenSilently` method on the `furo` object.

```js
const jwtAccessToken = await furo.getAccessTokenSilently();
```

If the user is logged in, a valid token will always be returned.
If the user is not logged in, `null` is returned.

For methods to verify the user's token and more detailed information about the token, refer to [here](/essentials/token-verify).

<Accordion title="Why a Valid Token is Always Returned">
  This method internally uses a `refresh_token` to renew the token. Therefore,
  if the stored token has expired, it automatically renews the token's validity
  period before returning it.
