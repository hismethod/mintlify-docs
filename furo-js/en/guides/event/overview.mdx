You can register callback functions that are called when events such as initialization completion, login, or logout occur.

```js
furo.on(eventType, callback);
```

The available event types are as follows:

- `init`: Triggered when initialization is complete.
- `login`: Triggered once when login is complete.
- `logout`: Triggered once when logout is complete.
- `user:set`: Triggered every time a user is assigned to `furo.user` after token issuance.

  The difference from the `login` event is that `login` occurs only when the initial login is complete, while `user:set` occurs when a user is retrieved with an existing token. This typically happens during a page refresh.
