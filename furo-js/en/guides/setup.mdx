## Install

Add the Furo.js script to your html `<head>` element.
This allows you to access furo's features from anywhere in your code.

```html index.html
<script src="https://cdn.furo.one/sdk/furo.min.js"></script>
```

<Note>
**Asynchronous or Deferred Loading of Furo.js**

You can also load Furo.js using the `async` or `defer` attributes of the script tag. However, be aware that if you use asynchronous loading, API calls should only be made after the script has fully executed.

</Note>

## Initialize

Initialization is a mandatory step before you start using Furo.js in earnest.<br/>
You can complete it by calling the `furo.init` method once at the entry point of your web framework.

To be recognized by Furo, you must call the initialization function using the `clientId` and `publicApiKey` that match your project.

<CodeGroup>
```html html
<script>
furo.init({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  publicApiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
});
</script>
```

```jsx React
// in your App.js or index.js
furo.init({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  publicApiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
});
```

</CodeGroup>
