## Authentication

Using the authentication API, you can manage all aspects of the user ID when using Furo. It provides endpoints for users to log in, sign up, and access APIs. API authorization is primarily done using the **Basic Auth** method. Some APIs also use **JWT Bearer** authentication, and specific instructions for these APIs are provided in the HTTP header.

## API Key

| Key             | API            | Publicly Available |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Public API Key  | Auth API       | Yes                |
| Private API Key | Management API | No                 |

You can find the Client ID and Public API Key/Admin API Key in the Furo Console's developer tools tab.
