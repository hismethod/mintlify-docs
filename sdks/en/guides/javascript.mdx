The Furo Javascript SDK is designed to easily integrate IAM (Identity and Access Management) features into web applications. This SDK offers a range of functionalities, including OAuth login, user management, and token management.

## Installation

<Warning>On the home screen of the [Furo Console](https://console.furo.one), select the Javascript SDK icon to copy a script configured for your project and use it as is.</Warning> The Javascript SDK can be loaded into your website using a script tag. Add the following script to your site's `<head>` element.

```html index.html
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdn.furo.one/sdk/furo.min.js"
  data-client-id="{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}"
  data-public-api-key="{YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY}"
></script>
```

Alternatively, you can insert a simpler version and pass the necessary values during the initialization phase without any issue.

```html index.html
<script defer src="https://cdn.furo.one/sdk/furo.min.js"></script>
```

## QuickStart

Have you installed the script in your siteâ€™s `<head>` element? If so, you can easily add login functionality to your web application using the Furo Javascript SDK. Follow the steps below to get started quickly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
  Initialize the SDK when the web page loads. To do this, add the following JavaScript code inside a `<script>` tag on your page.
```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    window.furo.init();
  });
</script>
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to the Login Button">
  Add a login button inside your `<body>` tag, and set it up to call the openLogin method when clicked.
```html
<button onclick="window.furo.openLogin()">Login</button>
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login Complete!">
