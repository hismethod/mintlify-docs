# Introductions

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) is a comprehensive managed service designed to facilitate the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases in a cloud environment. This service supports various relational database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft SQL Server. By automating routine tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling, RDS enhances database management efficiency.

Furthermore, Furo IAM integrates seamlessly with Amazon RDS, ensuring continuous operation and no downtime. Additionally, our professional team is available to assist in migrating your database to Furo IAM, even while your business operations continue uninterrupted.
