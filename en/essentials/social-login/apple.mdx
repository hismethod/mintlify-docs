To enable Apple OAuth, you first need to create an application on [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/). You'll then configure the Client ID, Client Secret, Team ID, and Key ID of the created application in the Furo Console.

## Creating the Application

You just need to enter the Furo Redirect URL.

## 3. Generating and Downloading a Key

Choose "Keys" from the left menu, then click the + button to create a key.

Select "Sign in with Apple" during key creation.

Once the key is created, click the "Download" button to download the key file. Be careful as you can only download it once.

## 4. Entering Required Values in the Furo Console

### Client ID

The Identifier of the Service ID is your Client ID.

### Team ID

<img src="/images/ap12.png" alt="apple" />

The value displayed next to your name in the top right corner of the screen is your Team ID.

### Key ID

Click on the created key to view its information, and you'll find the Key ID.

### Client Secret

When you download the key, a file named `AuthKey_{random string}.p8` will be downloaded to your "Downloads" folder. The content of this file is your Client Secret. Open it with a text editor, copy its content, and paste it into the Furo console.

## Furo Console Setting

After accessing the Furo Console, select "Configuration" on the left and choose "Login Method." You'll see the following screen.

After entering the Client ID, Key ID, Team ID, and the Client Secret you downloaded as a file, click the "Save" button to enable Apple login.
